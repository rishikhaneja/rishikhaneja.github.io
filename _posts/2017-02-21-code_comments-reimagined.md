title: Code Comments Reimagined
date: 2017-02-21
---

* Comments maintained in a separate file, like XML or JSON, and mapped to associated file's line numbers
* Editor view is a seemless merge of code and comments
* Comments added onto lines
* When lines are added or removed, comment's mapping is automatically updated
* Prompt whenever update not automatically resolvable
* Open source, universal support
