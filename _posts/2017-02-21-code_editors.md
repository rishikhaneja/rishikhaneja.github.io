## Commenting Reimagined
* Comments maintained in a separate file, like XML or JSON, and mapped to associated file's line numbers
* Editor view is a seemless merge of code and comments
* Comments added onto lines, not before or after
* When lines are added or removed, comment's mapping is automatically updated
* Prompt whenever update not automatically resolvable
* For Sublime Text, Phantoms API sounds promising [https://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-build-3124]

## Full Git Client Built In
* No external git client needed
* Full GUI support
* Live file and line status: original vs uncommited vs staged
* Instant diff with original
